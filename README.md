# Hospital Mortality Rate Patient Survival Prediction
## This repository contains materials about Hospital Mortality Rate Patient Survival Prediction Project including slides in pdf form and python codebook in jupyter notebook. 

## 
The predictors of in-hospital mortality for admitted patients remain poorly characterized. The  aim  of this project is to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among admitted patients, and identify factors that are most relevant to the ICU survival rate.
The project aims to perform analysis that can provide clinical research and public health professionals with valuable insights, save lives by increasing patientsâ€™ survival rates, and ultimately bring a positive impact to the community.
